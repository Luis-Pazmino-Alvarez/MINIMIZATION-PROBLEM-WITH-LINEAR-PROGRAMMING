# MINIMIZATION-PROBLEM-WITH-LINEAR-PROGRAMMING

This project explores how to solve a real-world linear programming minimization problem using Python. The objective is to find the optimal production levels of two products that minimize overall operational cost while satisfying constraints related to labor and machine hours.

üìå Problem Description
The optimization scenario models a company that produces two products. Each product consumes different quantities of labor and machine time, and each has an associated production cost. The goal is to determine the number of units of each product to produce in order to minimize the total cost, without exceeding available labor and machine resources.

üßÆ Methods Used
Linear Programming (LP)

Mathematical Modeling

SciPy‚Äôs linprog function

The model includes:

A linear objective function to minimize cost.

A set of inequality constraints for labor and machine availability.

Non-negativity constraints on decision variables.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
Python

NumPy

SciPy (scipy.optimize.linprog)

Matplotlib (for visualization)
